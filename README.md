[!NOTE]
Coding is like humor. If you have to explain it, it’s probably bad.

[!TIP]
Remember, "Hello, World!" is not just a phrase, it's a lifestyle.

[!IMPORTANT]
There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary and those who don’t.

[!WARNING]
Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack. Coding: Adding new needles to the haystack.

[!CAUTION]
Beware of code that compiles on the first run. It likely hides some evil trickery.
