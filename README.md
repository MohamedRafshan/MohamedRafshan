>[!NOTE]
>Coding is like humor. If you have to explain it, it’s probably bad.

>[!TIP]
>Remember, "Hello, World!" is not just a phrase, it's a lifestyle.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary and those who don’t.

>[!WARNING]
>Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack. Coding: Adding new needles to the haystack.

>[!CAUTION]
>Beware of code that compiles on the first run. It likely hides some evil trickery.
